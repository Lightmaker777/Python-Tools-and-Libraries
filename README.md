## Modules, imports and pip

In this exercise, we will focus on using imports on modules and on using package manager (pip).

## Tasks

### 

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task  - modules and imports 

Your task is to create two Python modules called `math_mod.py` and `string_mod.py` and another Python file `script.py`.  
First module should contain functions to:  
  * add,
  * subtract,
  * multiply,
  * and divide two numbers.  

Second module should contain functions to:  
  * concatenate two strings,
  * to create string from list,
  * and to check if string contains at least one digit.  

Next to the both modules third file should contain imports from both modules in the form: `import module` and `from module import something`.   
In your modules you can use modules from Python Standard Library.  
In the third file use all written functions from both modules.
>Hint: You can use [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) to gain more experience.
- Your results could look like this:


```bash
Result of adding 4 and 17 is 21
Result of subtracting  33 and 19  14
Result of multiplying  3 and 23 is 69
Result of dividing  44 by 3 is 14.666666666666666
Result of concatenation of 'Hello'' and 'DCI'' is HelloDCI
Result of creating string from list ['Hello'', 'DCI''] is HelloDCI
There is a digit in your string!
Result of checking digits in the string 'HelloDCI007' is True
```
